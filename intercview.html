    <summary> <b>what is css?why do we use it?  </b> </summary>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.</p>
</details>
<br> <br>
<details>
    <summary><b>In how many ways can we create css styling?What are they? </b>
    </summary>
    <p>CSS can be added to HTML in three ways. To style a single HTML element on the page, we can use inline CSS in a style attribute. We can include an internal stylesheet in your HTML document by including CSS in the head section. We can also link to an external stylesheet that contains all of your CSS apart from your HTML.</p>
</details>
<br> <br>
<details>
    <summary> <b>difference between the 3 types of css styles</b></summary>
